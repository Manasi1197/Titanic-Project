# Titanic-Project
Data Analysis of the case of titanic 
Here, I have done some data analysis using python-3 frameworks like matplotlib,seaborn etc.
I have imported the data from kaggle.com
Before running this project, you will have to install few of the packages using pip install. It will take few minutes only.
You can use anacondas' jupyter notebook for doing the same as there you will find most of the tools required to run the project (they are preintalled).
